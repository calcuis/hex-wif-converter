# hex-wif-converter

The given Python code defines a function `hex_to_wif(`hex_private_key`)` that converts a hexadecimal private key (typically used in cryptocurrency systems) into a Wallet Import Format (WIF) key. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

The code imports two libraries: `base58` for base58 encoding and `hashlib` for cryptographic hashing.

The `hex_to_wif` function takes a hexadecimal private key (`hex_private_key`) as input.

The private key is extended with a prefix byte '80', which is commonly used to indicate a mainnet private key in many cryptocurrency systems.

The extended private key is hashed twice using the SHA-256 hash function. The first hash (`first_hash`) is applied to the byte representation of the extended private key.

The second hash (`second_hash`) is applied to the result of the first hash. This double hashing is a common practice in many cryptocurrency systems to improve security.

The first 4 bytes of the second hash are extracted to create a checksum.

The checksum is appended to the end of the extended private key.

The extended private key with the checksum is encoded using base58 encoding. Base58 encoding is used in cryptocurrency systems to represent binary data in a more human-friendly form compared to hexadecimal encoding.

The encoded result is the Wallet Import Format (WIF) key.

The function returns the WIF key.

The provided hexadecimal private key is converted to its corresponding WIF key using the `hex_to_wif` function.

The resulting WIF key is printed as output.

In summary, this code snippet demonstrates the conversion of a hexadecimal private key into a WIF key, which is a common format used to import and manage private keys in various cryptocurrency wallets.
